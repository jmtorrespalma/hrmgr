What is it?
-----------
Holiday Rummager is intended to do an extensive research and study on flights,
hotels and other offers on different days. This data extraction can be used
later with any purpose, but it's something that I created as something
personal to satisfy my traveling bug :)

Latest version
--------------
The flight detective project is currently being hosted on Github, more
concretely in the address https://github.com/jmtorrespalma/hrmgr.git,
but the intention is to migrate it to a private server while maintaining this
one as a mirror.

Licensing
---------
See the file accompanying this project called COPYING.

Documentation
-------------
The only sources of documentation are this file, along with the commented
souce code and the provided templates but due to the simplicity of the tool,
it's considered to be enough.

Building
